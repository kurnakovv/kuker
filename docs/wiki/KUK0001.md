## 💡 Title  
Kuk0001DuplicateArgumentsPassedToMethodAnalyzer

## 🆔 Rule ID  
**KUK0001**

## 📝 Description  
This rule detects cases where the same argument is passed multiple times to a method as different arguments.

Such situations are usually caused by copy-paste mistakes or duplicated parameters with the same type.  
In most APIs this is either meaningless or leads to incorrect behavior (for example, copying a stream into itself).

A diagnostic is reported when the first argument and any of the other arguments refer to the same object.

## ❔ Why this is a problem  
Passing the same object as multiple arguments can:

- Lead to runtime errors or undefined behavior
- Make the code harder to understand and maintain
- Hide copy-paste bugs that are difficult to notice during code review

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can configure the severity of the rule or exclude specific methods using .editorconfig.
```.editorconfig
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.KUK0001.severity = warning # Object used as argument to its own argument analyzer | https://github.com/kurnakovv/kuker/wiki/KUK0001
dotnet_diagnostic.KUK0001.excluded_methods = Foo,Bar # Optional | Ignore selected methods
```

## 💻 Example
```cs
async void TestMethod(CancellationToken token)
{
    var stream = new MemoryStream();
    var other = new MemoryStream();

    await stream.CopyToAsync(stream, token); // ❌ Violation: source and destination are the same
    await stream.CopyToAsync(other, token);  // ✅ OK
}
```

## 🗒️ Notes  

- The rule compares argument expressions semantically, not just by name.
- Only method calls are analyzed.
- Excluded methods are matched by name.
